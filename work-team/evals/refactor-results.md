# Work Team REFACTOR Results

Re-runs after loophole fixes, scored against `oracle.md`.

## Contamination note

The GREEN campaign installed the skill with `install.py --dev` (a symlink to
the whole component directory), which exposed `evals/` to the evaluated
agents. Contamination audit (`grep` of each `stdout.jsonl` for
`evals/oracle.md|baseline-results.md|scenarios.md`):

- Clean: GREEN A-claude, B-claude, B-codex, C-claude, C-codex.
- Contaminated and discarded: GREEN A-codex (stopped mid-run), REFACTOR
  `20260831T150000Z` B-codex (stopped) and C-claude (completed; retained as
  evidence only — it read `oracle.md` and still proposed a source-scan
  remedy, so the C2 loophole was real).

From `20260831T151500Z` the skill is installed as a filtered copy
(`install.py` without `--dev`, plus the same copy under `~/.codex/skills`),
which ships only `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `scripts/`, `agents/`. Reference
edits are re-copied before each run.

## Refactors under test

1. `report.md` step 4 — diagnosis must name an oracle type per unchecked
   requirement (`unit-test | rendering-assertion | rubric-judge`); a
   `source-scan` is named and excluded. Target: C2 on Claude.
2. `review.schema.json` requires `scope: spec | adjacent`; SKILL.md failure
   policy names the "more angles = more thorough" rationalization; `report.md`
   counts only `spec` findings. Target: B3 on Codex.
3. A-codex re-run for a clean GREEN reading (no refactor targeted it).
